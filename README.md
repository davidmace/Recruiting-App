A simple recruiting app to let students discover and connect with startups.

There's a separate Android client for students to scroll through companies tinder-style and this is a web client
for companies to browse interested students. This was basically an experiment with Node.js, Parse, making APIs, and
passing information from clients and we use this to handle recruiting for the hackathons I organize.
